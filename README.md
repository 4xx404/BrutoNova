# BrutoNova  

Hash Cracker, Web Directory Brute Forcer & md5 Database.  

BrutoNova is a multitool designed for password cracking & brute force. Usage is self explanatory.  

Tools:  
1. hashCrack
* Use online & offline wordlists  
* Crack SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384 & SHA3-512 hashes  
2. webBrute
* Website directory brute force
* Use with or without an extension  
3. hashDB  
Since MD5 encryption is irreversible, the MD5 Database enables you to store plain text strings & their equivalent hashed string for fast offline search  
* Quickly hash full wordlists into the database  
  
The database already includes the top-10000 wordlist from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt.  

I intend to add more hash types & brute force tools in future updates.
