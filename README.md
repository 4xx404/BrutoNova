# BrutoNova  

Hash Cracker, Web Directory Brute Forcer & md5 Database.  

BrutoNova is a multitool designed for password cracking & brute force. Usage is self explanatory.  

Tools:  
    hashCrack - Use online & offline wordlists to crack SHA1 hashes.  
    webBrute - Website directory brute force tool, use with or without an extension.  
    hashDB - MD5 Database to store plain text & md5 hashed versions for fast search. You can also hash a full wordlist & update it into the database. The database already includes the top-10000 wordlist.  

I intend to add more hash types in future updates.
